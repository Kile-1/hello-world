Hello world.
My name is Kile Wilke. I am a 17 year old living in Evansville, Indiana. I am a junior at my highschool, but I go to Ivy Tech community College as a full time student. I am currently working on my software development degree; I hope to have an associates in software development when I graduate highschool. This is my first time using github, and it will certainly not be my last.
